# Iris Dataset Classification using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates unsupervised machine learning using the **Iris dataset**. The goal is to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features using **K-Means clustering**. The **Elbow Method** is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 4 features each:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization
- K-Means clustering implementation
- Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
- Cluster visualization with clear labeling

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd iris-kmeans
Run the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Iris_Clustering.ipynb
Results
Clusters are visualized and compared with the actual species.

The Elbow Method indicates the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.
